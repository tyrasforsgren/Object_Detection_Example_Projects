# Image Processing and Object Detection Projects

This repository contains three distinct modules for image processing and object detection. Each module provides specific functionalities for working with images, detecting objects, and analyzing shapes.

## Projects Overview

### 1. MyImageProcessor Module

The `MyImageProcessor` module offers various functionalities for processing images. It includes methods for color conversion, resizing, adding frames, finding the center of the image, and detecting faces using OpenCV.

#### Key Features
- **Color Conversion**: Convert images between BGR, RGB, and grayscale.
- **Resizing**: Resize images to different scales.
- **Frame Addition**: Add frames around images.
- **Center Finding**: Identify and mark the center of images.
- **Face Detection**: Detect faces using a Haar cascade classifier.

### 2. Object Detection and Classification Module
The Object Detection and Classification Module provides comprehensive solutions for detecting and classifying objects in images and videos using YOLOv4. It supports object detection and includes functionalities for processing and saving results.

#### Key Features
- **Object Detection**: Detect objects using the YOLOv4 model.
- **Image Processing**: Process images to detect and classify objects.
- **Video Processing**: Analyze video frames for object detection.
- **Result Saving**: Save detected objects into categorized folders.

### 3. RegularShapeDetector Module
The RegularShapeDetector module is designed to detect and analyze regular shapes within an image using contour analysis techniques. It identifies shapes such as circles, squares, and triangles and provides tools for shape analysis.

#### Key Features
- **Shape Detection**: Identify regular shapes like circles, squares, and triangles.
- **Shape Analysis**: Analyze shapes for regularity and type.
- **Result Export**: Save shape data to a CSV file.
- **Image Display**: Visualize the original image with detected shapes.
